# Flexible Drone Design

This project focuses on the design and development of a flexible drone system. It includes drone firmware, motor control, sensor integration, schematics, PCB layout, and project documentation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Features

- **Drone Firmware**: Control logic for the drone, written in Arduino-compatible code.
- **Motor Control**: Custom motor control logic for optimal drone performance.
- **Sensor Integration**: Code for integrating sensors into the drone system.
- **Schematics**: Includes designs for the flexible printed circuit and motor controller.
- **PCB Layout**: PCB layout and schematic files created using KiCad for the droneâ€™s flexible printed circuit.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation explaining the project, the technology behind FPC, and power optimization strategies.
